# camplight

![camplight](camplight-pic.png)

camplight is a little camping warning light with neopixels. it is powered by an ATtiny85, which can be powered by a li-po battery under the pcb. the camplight would be put together using glue and some double sided tape to attach the pcb to the case, as I can't think of a better way to do it.

### the pcb
the pcb files can be found in the pcb folder.

### the casing
the case consists of 4 components which are the main base, the top, the button and an acrylic piece.
