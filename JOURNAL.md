## Day 1
Today, I started some research about how I could do this, and I think I want to try and make a Attiny85 dev board thing (or something like that!). Andddd I found some resources:

- https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny85
- https://github.com/tomasr8/attiny85-dev-board
- https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/v2.0.0-devThis-is-the-head-submit-PRs-against-this/avr/extras/tinyNeoPixel.md

Weeeell, lets just say I didn't really understand the datasheet... Still, I did some googling and found some examples. I guess what they usually have is like, the chip, a voltage regulator, a bunch of resistors.. diodes... etc.. looking at the example though, it made me understand more, which was awesome :D

### The Plan
sooo here's what I'm gonna like add;

- battery
- built in neopixels or some led
- usb-c?
